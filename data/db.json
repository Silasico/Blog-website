I've sought for some YouTube videos in relation to this courses which have given me some basic knowledge of the course. In search of more knowledge, I came across this course on Coursera, front-end web development and I decided to apply for the financial aid in order to improve my knowledge as well as become a technologically sound individual So I can be useful to not only myself but also be able to provide a solution to the declining Nigerian economy with my learnt skills.",
